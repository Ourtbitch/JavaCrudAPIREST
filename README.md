**Project Description:**

Develop a server-side application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a RESTful API. The application will be built using Java with the Spring Boot framework, leveraging Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and PostgreSQL as the database management system.

**Technologies Used:**

-   **Java**: The programming language for developing the application.
-   **Spring Boot**: The framework for building and deploying the RESTful API with ease.
-   **Hibernate**: The ORM tool used to map Java objects to database tables and manage database transactions.
-   **PostgreSQL**: The relational database management system for storing and managing the data.
